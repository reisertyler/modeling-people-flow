The number of cores used for parallel processing is determined by the `cpu_cores` parameter passed during the initialization of the `DataProcessor` object. The method returns a dictionary where the keys are building names and the values are the processed DataFrames for each building. This design enhances performance, especially when processing large amounts of data across multiple files.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `DataProcessor` class focuses on data processing, while the `SpeedTest` class provides a reusable way to measure execution time. This is an example of object-oriented design.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DataProcessor` class is responsible for processing time-series data from CSV files. It reads the data, interpolates missing values, and processes data for all buildings in parallel. The class is designed to be flexible, allowing the user to specify parameters like the data directory, date range, building ID, CPU cores, and sampling frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `SpeedTest` class is a utility class that measures the execution time of a function or method. It's implemented as a callable class, which means it can be used as a decorator to easily add timing functionality to any function or method. In this case, it's used to measure the time taken by the process_all_buildings method of the DataProcessor class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `DataProcessor `Class\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialization Method (`__init__`):\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DataProcessor` class is initialized with parameters which include the directory where the CSV files are stored, the start and end dates for the data to be considered, a specific building_id if the user would like to process data for a particular building only, the number of CPU cores to utilize for the computation, the frequency at which to sample data, and a boolean to decide whether to record the total execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DataProcessor` class used the following methods internally:\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reading Data Method (`read_time_series_data`):\n",
    "\n",
    "The `read_time_series_data` method is a static method, meaning it does not depend on the state of the DataProcessor instance. This method reads data from a CSV file and returns a DataFrame. It also converts the \"datetime\" column to actual datetime objects for easy handling in subsequent methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Interpolating Data Method (`interpolate_time_series_data`):\n",
    "\n",
    "The `interpolate_time_series_data` method implements interpolation on the provided data. This is useful to fill gaps in the dataset where data points might be missing. With the help of the pandas.date_range function, a date range object is created from the minimum date to the maximum date with a frequency set by the `sample_freq` attribute. The method then interpolates the missing data points and returns an updated DataFrame. The method is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Building Identifiers Method (`_get_building_identifiers` and `_get_buildings`):\n",
    "\n",
    "The `_get_building_identifiers` is a static method that retrieves the building identifiers from a given filename. It splits the filename, which has the structure `buildingID_Extracted_Data_date.csv`, into a list using \"_\" as the delimiter and then returns the building id.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data Processing Method (`_process_building_data` and `process_all_buildings`):\n",
    "\n",
    "The `_process_building_data` method processes the data for a single building. It uses the `read_time_series_data` method to read the dataset and `interpolate_time_series_data` to interpolate missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `process_all_buildings` method applies the above steps to all buildings. It first gets the list of buildings to process, either a single one if `building_id` is provided, or all buildings in the directory otherwise. Then, using joblib's Parallel and delayed functions, it processes data for all these buildings in parallel, making efficient use of multiple CPU cores if available. It returns a dictionary where keys are building names and values are DataFrames containing corresponding processed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `record_time` is set True, it records and returns execution time for data processing. This is used for performance testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `SpeedTest` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a wrapper for the DataProcessor class and is used to measure the execution time of any function or method. In this package, it is only being used to record the time taken to process the data.\n",

    "The processing of data interpolation for 144 points across 77 buildings was significantly expedited by utilizing all 10 cores on a Apple M1 Pro with a 10-core processor and 32 gb of unified memory. The time required for this operation was reduced from 5.2 seconds to 1.3 seconds, demonstrating the efficiency of parallel processing independent CSV files, but it isn't a massive jump in performance The output data remained consistent, despite the increased processing speed, and was not printed again for brevity. This improvement in performance uses a straightforward strategy where each processing unit operates on a `.csv` file independently, as the memory does not depend on each other, By default, the system will utilize the maximum number of CPU cores available. However, if any issues arise, one can manually set `cpu_cores = 1` to only execute one process at a time.\n",
