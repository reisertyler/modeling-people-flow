# DIRECTORY: Source Code

This is an overview page of the source code directory created by TYLER A. REISER on NOVEMBER 16, 2024. It will be updated within the next few weeks.

There is currently one folder in this directory called `python` and this `README.md` file. As the name suggests, this folder is where Python code is stored and is currently being used in Jupyter Notebooks. Eventually, there will be other folders that will run the Python code on a high-performance computing cluster. Within the folder labeled `python`, there are numerous modules that are in alphabetical order:

1. data_plotter
2. decomps
3. processor
4. sindy
5. time_series
