## WiFi Traffic Analysis
This is a project by the NSF-GHOST, Traffic Analysis team at University of Colorado Boulder to hide network traffic and events. The campus WiFi system is used to simulate a 5G network for a proof-of-concept demonstration. This project is done in collaboration with Federated Wireless and includes support from University of Colorado Office of Information Technology.
